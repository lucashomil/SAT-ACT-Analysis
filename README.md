# SAT-ACT-Analysis

## Problem Statement
As part of admission requirements for the US colleges and universities, both the ACT and SAT are well-known standardized tests. Each test measures students' proficiency in different areas such as Maths, Reading, English, etc.

In this Exploration Data Analysis, I will be analysing SAT and ACT scores as well as participation rates from each state in the United States. Then, I will be identifying a trend in the data and combine the data analysis with domain research to identify likely factors influencing participation rates and scores in various states.

Therefore, we can make a recommendation to the College Board that administers the SAT, wants to tracks state-wide participation and recommends where the money is best spent to improve SAT participation rates.

# Conclusions and Recommendations

## Conclusions:
There are 19 states with SAT participation rate of 60% or greater. Whereas there are 30 states with ACT participation rate of 60% of more. The board should give scholarship to students who participate in SAT exams rather than ACT to increase participation rate for SAT. For instance, Missouri as a SAT participation rate of 3% in 2017 and 4% in SAT 2018. This can be surely brought up by giving students incentives to take SATs.

## Recommendations:
In order to increase the participation of both test ACT and SAT, the College Board should collaborate with state departments of education and local education agencies set up a state-wide testing requirements, full or partial funding or free test preparation programs. In addition, the College Board should cover all or part of exam fees, offer more SAT school Days, collect more data from school district to help find more suitable target.
